**InfiniBand**
==============

InfiniBand (abbreviated IB) is an alternative to Ethernet and Fibre Channel. IB provides high bandwidth and low latency. IB can transfer data directly to and from a storage device on one machine to userspace on another machine, bypassing and avoiding the overhead of a system call. IB adapters can handle the networking protocols, unlike Ethernet networking protocols which are ran on the CPU. This allows the OS's and CPU's to remain free while the high bandwidth transfers take place, which can be a real problem with 10Gb+ Ethernet.

IB hardware is made by Mellanox and Intel. IB is most often used by supercomputers, clusters, and data centers.

**InfiniBand HDR Director Switch**
**********************************

* Mellanox HDR InfiniBand capable of 200Gbps
* Currently used in compute and storage nodes with HDR-100 at 100Gbps speed
* Single switch with full connectivity of all Ibex components from compute to storage
* Increasing the performance of IO and communications from previous 40Gbps network.

This example shows a Mellanox Technologies (MT) adapter. Its PCI Device ID is reported (4123), rather than the model number of part number. It shows a state of "Active", which means is it properly connected to a subnet manager. It shows a physical state of "LinkUp", which means it has an electrical connection via cable, but is not necessarily properly connected to a subnet manager. It shows a total rate of 100 Gb/s.
