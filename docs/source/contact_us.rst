The KAUST Supercomputing Laboratory (KSL) currently runs a website (www.hpc.kaust.edu.sa) gathering all information about Ibex Cluster.

**Maintenance**

Disruptive maintenance will be avoided, whenever possible.  We aim to use a slot no more frequently than twice a month and will, when possible, give at least 7 days notice of the systems being taken out of service.

**News**

News about upcoming maintenance and other system events will be published in the "message of the day" displayed at login and on the general channel on `Slack <https://app.slack.com/client/T5CEBNQBA/C5CEBNS0Y>`_.

**Email**

All current and potential laboratory users are encouraged to contact us at ibex@hpc.kaust.edu.sa 
All questions, comments, or requests are addressed from there. Our staff is traditionally quite responsive over email: be assured that your inquiry will be directed to the appropriate member of the laboratory staff. We can also be reached on `Slack <https://app.slack.com/client/T5CEBNQBA/C5CEBNS0Y>`_ .

Please include the following information (if applicable):

#.  Your name and contact details
#.  The behaviour you are seeing, including any error messages. (Shell output is most useful.)
#.  The behaviour you expect to see.
#.  The resource on which you are experiencing your problem (e.g. Shaheen)
#.  The programming environment you are using (e.g., compiler, libraries, applications)
