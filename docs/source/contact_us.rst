There are multiple venues you can contact us for support and information. Before sending a support request, be sure to navigate and search the documentation for related information. 

The easiest and most efficient way is to email helpdesk:

* Shaheen III `contact form <https://hpc.kaust.edu.sa/contact-us>`_
* Shaheen III helpdesk    :email:`<help@hpc.kaust.edu.sa>`
* Ibex cluster helpdesk   :email:`<ibex@hpc.kaust.edu.sa>`
  
Ibex cluster also supports users via a `Slack channel <https://app.slack.com/client/T5CEBNQBA/C5CEBNS0Y>`_. As a rule of thumb, if the issue is complex to describe, please send an email for requesting support. If the question is of general nature and can be stated in a line or two,  `Slack channel <https://app.slack.com/client/T5CEBNQBA/C5CEBNS0Y>`_ is most appropriate. 

.. note:: 
    The `Slack channel <https://app.slack.com/client/T5CEBNQBA/C5CEBNS0Y>`_ is only of question related to Ibex. Shaheen III support request must be sent via email to the :email:`helpdesk <help@hpc.kaust.edu.sa>`
