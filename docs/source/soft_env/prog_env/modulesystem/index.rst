Introduction
=============

Linux modulesystem is a tool for enabling dynamically changing the environment of existing Linux ``shell``. It is commonly used where multiple environments are expected to be used by one or multiple users. Rules can be added a ``modulefile`` and contains changes to be implemented when switching an environment from default to the desired. 

A comprehensive set of software has already been optimally compiled on Ibex and made available to users via modulesystem.

Some basic commands a user is assumed to know when using pre-installed software on KSL systems. For specific KSL system, please refer to the link below.
