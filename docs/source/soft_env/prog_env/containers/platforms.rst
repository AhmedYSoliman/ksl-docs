Containerization Platforms at KSL Clusters
==========================================

KSL provides various containerization platforms across different clusters to help users manage and deploy their applications efficiently. Below is an overview of the containerization platforms available on the Ibex, shaheen3, and Neser clusters.

Ibex Cluster
------------

The Ibex cluster offers the following containerization platform:

- **Singularity**: Singularity is available on Ibex, allowing you to create, manage, and run containers for your applications. It is suitable for a wide range of HPC workloads and provides excellent compatibility with HPC environments.

Shaheen3 Cluster
-----------------

The shaheen3 cluster provides the following containerization platform:

- **Singularity**: Similar to the Ibex cluster, shaheen3 supports Singularity as a containerization platform. Singularity enables you to encapsulate your applications and execute them with near-native performance.

Neser Cluster
--------------

The Neser cluster offers the following containerization platform:

- **Podman**: Neser supports Podman, a daemonless containerization tool. With Podman, you can create, manage, and run containers without requiring a central daemon, which enhances security and flexibility.

Choosing the Right Platform
---------------------------

When selecting a containerization platform for your workloads, consider factors such as compatibility, performance, security, and ease of use. Depending on your specific needs and familiarity with the platforms, you can choose the platform that best aligns with your goals.
