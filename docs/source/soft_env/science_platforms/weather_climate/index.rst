.. note::

    Page under construction

- This is a page tree where we can showcase the ways Weather and Climate scientists can use KSL systems easily
- This gives us a motivation to define an opinionated software enviroment activated with mimimal commands
- We also create content of example workflows related to e.g. weather data processing, and hyperlink to resources documented on other pages in this website.
