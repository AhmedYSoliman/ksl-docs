==========================================

Dask is a library for parallel computing in Python. From a programmerâ€™s point of view, it has two components:

#. Dynamic task scheduler to optimize computation as farm of tasks. Once tasks are formed Dask can pipeline them as a workflow engine/manager and schedule them on available resources

#. Data structure representations called collections which are conducive to larger than memory computation when dealing with Big Data. When working with these data structures, a Python developer trades in familiar territories as working with Numpy, Pandas or Python futures etc. These collections leverage from the task scheduler to run.
