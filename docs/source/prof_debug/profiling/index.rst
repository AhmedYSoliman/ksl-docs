Performance analysis is a key step for efficient development and usage of scientific codes on supercomputers featuring heterogeneous architectures such as CPUs and GPUs.

When dealing with large and complex research code on high performance computing systems, the need to profile the performance becomes necessary to achieve high degree of performance optimization. This requires software tools such as a  profiler with scaled efficiency that can provide accurate information without creating performance bottlenecks.

The following tools are available for performance analysis:
